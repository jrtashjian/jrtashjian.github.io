## Editor

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is what I use each day and lately I've been loving the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme with the [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (without the ligatures).

I've enabled a number of extensions for syntax highlighting, source formatting, etc. but here are a few of the important ones:

- [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) allows me to stay in the editor while I review PR's, manage issues, and deploy my work.
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [Markdown Preview Github Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles) gives me an accurate representation of markdown files when viewed on GitHub.
- [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) allows me to debug API endpoints quickly and easily while maintaing a "scratchpad" in the process.
