## Editor

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is what I use each day and lately I've been loving the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme with the [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (without the ligatures).

I've enabled a number of extensions for syntax highlighting, source formatting, etc. but here are a few of the important ones:

- [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) allows me to stay in the editor while I review PR's, manage issues, and deploy my work.
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [Markdown Preview Github Styling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles) gives me an accurate representation of markdown files when viewed on GitHub.
- [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) allows me to debug API endpoints quickly and easily while maintaing a "scratchpad" in the process.

## Hardware

My personal development and gaming computer is running an [AMD Ryzen 7 5800X](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/qtvqqs/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-38-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000063wof) processor with [32 GB of DDR4-3200](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/dHjJ7P/gskill-trident-z-rgb-32gb-2-x-16gb-ddr4-3200-memory-f4-3200c16d-32gtzrx) memory and a [AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/HY4BD3/asus-tuf-rx6800xt-o16g-gaming-radeon-rx-6800-xt-16-gb-video-card-tuf-rx6800xt-o16g-gaming) GPU. Here's the full loadout:

I also use an [iPhone 11 Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP805), [Apple Watch Series 7](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP860), and an [iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd Generation)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP843). I honestly wish I could ditch the iPhone and just wear an Apple Watch and use a mirrorless camera for photos and videos. I also prefer the iPad over an under-powered processor inside laptop, especially since I can just run Visual Studio Code remotely and in the browser to take advantage of a desktop or server processor.

For my day job I use a [MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP858) with the Apple M1 Pro and 32GB of memory.
