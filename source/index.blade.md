Hello! My name is JR Tashjian.

I am a believer and follower of Christ. I am passionate about seeking out challenges and finding solutions to complex problems through code. I currently work at [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com/) on the WordPress Experience team as a Senior Software Engineer. I have also worked as an independent contractor and at various companies, including [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), [Packet Tide](https://packettide.com/), [10up](https://10up.com/), and [Overit](https://overit.com/). In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to the [WordPress Core](https://wordpress.org/) and [Gutenberg](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg) Open Source projects.

If you'd like to connect, please feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:hello@jrtashjian.com) or on [Mastodon](https://talos.link/@jrtashjian). I'd love to hear from you!
