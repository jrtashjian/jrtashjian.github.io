## Life
I am a thinker and one idea that I continue to ponder each day has spawned from a quote during an [interview with Tim Mackie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6c_av6mT38) of [The Bible Project](https://bibleproject.com/). This was in response to a question about how we frame our life with Jesus in our day-to-day.

> it's the battle to do what is best for me and to redefine good and evil for my own convenience, comfort, and benefit at the expense of the people around me.

## Work
I'm working at [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com) alongside an amazing team to build the best experiences we can. Most of my job is experimenting with the [Block Editor](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) in [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) for internal projects which may eventually become open source as well as [many already open source projects](https://github.com/godaddy-wordpress) such as [CoBlocks](https://github.com/godaddy-wordpress/coblocks) and the [Go](https://github.com/godaddy-wordpress/go) theme.
