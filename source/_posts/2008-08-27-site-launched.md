Hey everyone! My name is JR Tashjian and I am a Web Developer living and working in New York.

I started this blog because I wanted to write about what I do and what I learn as well as educate any readers wanting to learn more about Web Development. I will be focusing on the Back-End (server side) coding of projects using PHP and MySQL. I will also write a little about Front-End (client side) coding using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As for post consistency, I haven't set anything nor do I plan to. I will write articles as I have time but, I will aim for one or two posts a week.

Well, I am very excited about this launch! I hope everyone who reads my articles will find this site a valuable resource for learning Web Development. If you have any topics you would like me to write about or have a question you want answered, feel free to [email](mailto:hello@jrtashjian.com) and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Check back often for updates! While your waiting, get the [feed](/feed.xml)!
