I am so excited to announce that I’m joining [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)!

I’ll be joining as a Software Engineer on the WordPress Experience team starting Monday. I can’t express how excited I am about this opportunity, every bit of it is surreal. I’ll be working alongside [Rich Tabor](https://richtabor.com/), changing the way people use [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) on [GoDaddy’s Managed WordPress](https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting) platform.

The passion and excitement I’ve experienced from everyone I met at GoDaddy during this process was refreshing and invigorating. I’ve taken notice to how GoDaddy has changed from the outside over the years and this past month has confirmed it for me. I’m proud to join this amazing company and team!

Amazing things are coming.
