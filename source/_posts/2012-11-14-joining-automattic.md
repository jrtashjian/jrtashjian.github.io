I'm very excited to announce that today marks the first day of my employment as a *Code Wrangler* at [Automattic](https://automattic.com)!

Automattic is the company behind [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com) and other [various](https://jetpack.com/) [awesome](https://vaultpress.com/) [products](https://akismet.com/). I've been using WordPress for some time now and am so grateful to finally be a part of the team. My dream job!

I'm currently going through the first 3 weeks of customer support for WordPress.com that every new employee completes. After that, I'll be joining the [VaultPress](https://vaultpress.com/) team to work on the amazing backup system for WordPress.
