I'm excited to announce that today marks the first day of my employment as a *Web Engineer* at [10up](https://10up.com)!

Being an independent consultant for the past two years has been a blast but I've missed working with a dedicated team towards a common goal. 10up has always been a huge name in the WordPress community both in what they do for their clients and what they contribute back into the community.

They've created [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) for local WordPress development which I use each and every day already, the [ElasticPress](https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress) plugin, [WP_Mock](https://github.com/10up/wp_mock) for unit testing within WordPress, and [a number of other projects](https://github.com/10up). I'm excited to be a part of this amazing team and contributing to its growth.
